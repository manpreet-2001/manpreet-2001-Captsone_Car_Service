2. Create password for "Car Service"
3. Copy the **16-character code** (like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### **Step 3: Add to .env File**

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop

# Display Settings
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Car Service Platform
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Keep your other settings (MongoDB, JWT, etc.)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/carservice
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_here
PORT=5000
```

### **Step 4: Verify Again**

## 🧪 Three Ways to Test

### **Method 1: Quick Test Script** (Fastest)

```bash
node src/utils/testEmail.js
```

**Sends 3 test emails** to your inbox. Check for:
- Booking Confirmation
- Booking Confirmed  
- Service Completed

---

### **Method 2: Live Booking Test** (Most Realistic)

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start Frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Create a Booking:**
   - Login as customer
   - Book a service
   - Check email inbox

4. **Watch Console:**
   ```
   ✅ Email sent to customer@example.com: Booking Confirmation
   ✅ Email sent to mechanic@example.com: New Booking Request
   ```

---

### **Method 3: Server Startup Check**

```bash
npm start
```

Look for this line when server starts:
```
✅ Email server is ready to send messages
```

If you see this, email is configured correctly!

## 📧 Where to Look for Emails

1. **Primary Inbox** - Check first
2. **Spam/Junk Folder** - New senders often go here

4. **Search** - Search for "Car Service Platform"
