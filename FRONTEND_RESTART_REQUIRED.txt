║          WHY BOOKING WENT TO OWEN (NOT GARY)                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

❌ PROBLEM:
You selected Gary, but email sent to Owen@gmail.com

🔍 WHY THIS HAPPENED:

1. Frontend is running OLD code (started before we added mechanic selection)
2. Old booking form doesn't have mechanic dropdown
3. Old code doesn't send mechanic field in request
4. Backend receives booking WITHOUT mechanic field
5. Backend falls back to service.mechanic (Owen)
6. Email goes to Owen ❌

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ THE FIX:

STEP 1: STOP FRONTEND
──────────────────────
Find your frontend terminal window (where npm start is running)
Press: Ctrl+C

STEP 2: RESTART FRONTEND
────────────────────────
npm start

STEP 3: WAIT FOR IT TO LOAD
────────────────────────────
Look for:
  Compiled successfully!
  webpack compiled with 0 warnings
  
  You can now view frontend in the browser.
  Local: http://localhost:3000

STEP 4: REFRESH BROWSER
────────────────────────
Press F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)

STEP 5: LOGIN AGAIN
────────────────────
Login as Manpreet or Saahil

STEP 6: GO TO "BOOK SERVICE"
─────────────────────────────
Click "Book Service" tab

STEP 7: YOU'LL NOW SEE:
────────────────────────
✅ Select Vehicle
✅ Select Service
✅ Select Mechanic ← THIS IS NEW!
✅ Select Date & Time

STEP 8: TRY AGAIN
──────────────────
1. Select: Transmission Service
2. Select: Gary ← Choose Gary!
3. Select: Date and time
4. Submit

STEP 9: CHECK CONSOLE
──────────────────────
Backend will show:
✅ Email sent to customer@gmail.com: Booking Confirmation
✅ Email sent to gary@gmail.com: New Booking Request ← GARY!

🎯 HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING:

BEFORE FRONTEND RESTART:
  - No mechanic dropdown in booking form ❌
  - Bookings auto-go to Owen ❌

AFTER FRONTEND RESTART:
  - Mechanic dropdown appears! ✅
  - You can select Gary, Owen, Mike, etc. ✅
  - Booking goes to selected mechanic! ✅
  - Email goes to selected mechanic! ✅

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 QUICK CHECKLIST:

Frontend Restart:
  [ ] Stop frontend (Ctrl+C)
  [ ] Start frontend (npm start)
  [ ] Wait for "Compiled successfully!"
  [ ] Refresh browser (F5)
  [ ] Login as customer
  [ ] Go to "Book Service"
  [ ] SEE mechanic dropdown ✅

Test Booking:
  [ ] Select service
  [ ] SELECT GARY in mechanic dropdown
  [ ] Choose date/time
  [ ] Submit
  [ ] Watch console
  [ ] See: "Email sent to gary@gmail.com"
  [ ] Login as Gary
  [ ] See booking in Gary's dashboard ✅

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💡 WHY RESTART IS NEEDED:

Frontend (React) loads code once when it starts:
  - Started at 10:00 → Loaded old code (no mechanic selection)
  - We added feature at 10:30 → Frontend still has old code
  - User books at 10:35 → Uses old code (no mechanic field)
  - Restart at 10:40 → Loads new code (with mechanic selection)
  - User books at 10:45 → Uses new code (mechanic field sent!)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎊 AFTER RESTART YOU'LL HAVE:

✅ Mechanic selection dropdown
✅ Choose Owen, Gary, or any mechanic
✅ Booking goes to YOUR selected mechanic
✅ Email goes to YOUR selected mechanic
✅ Fair distribution of bookings
✅ Works for any number of mechanics

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TL;DR:
1. Ctrl+C in frontend terminal
2. npm start
3. Refresh browser (F5)
4. Book service → SELECT GARY
5. Check backend console
6. Should show: "Email sent to gary@gmail.com" ✅

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DO THIS NOW:
Stop frontend (Ctrl+C) → npm start → Try booking again!

The mechanic selection will work! 🚀
